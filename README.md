# LaTeX-Report-Template
This is a simple LaTeX template to use for university assignments or research reports, when you need a clean and professional look.

Currently, it includes a title, math, tables, list and bibliography, and Greek character packages. Before your first compile, you need to install these packages, either automatically (from TeXLive or other editor) or manually (e.g. from the MiKTeX Package Manager). If you use the packages for Greek Characters, you need to compile with XeLaTeX.

I have used [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/download) and [TeXLive](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) to create and compile the file. 

This template will be updated soon.
